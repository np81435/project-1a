    <h1>My Favorite New Orleans Restaurants</h1>
        <div>
        <p id="intro">
    The city of New Orleans is well know for its food culture.  While outsiders only think of the French Quarter and gumbo, we locals know that this city has a diverse ethnic food culture that spans Orleans, Jefferson and St. Bernard Parishes.

        1  Drago's, Metarie LA</h2>
        
        <p>
            

Drago's Restaurant has been a culinary staple ever since Drago and Klara Cvitanovich opened their restaurant in 1969. They set out to offer delicious seafood and a good time to guests for a reasonable price. The must order item here is their famous chargrilled oysters!

        <p class="info">
        Is there good pizza in New Orleans you ask?  The answer is heck yes!  Located in the Bywater, Pizza Deliciuos is one of our favorite resaurants.  Don't let the name fool you, they make more than pizza.  The dish to get here is house made pasta.  This is the best pasta I have ever had!
